# Shortest Path Finder
Shortest Path Finder is a minor project that helps find the optimal path from a source location to a destination using various algorithms such as A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.

# Features
1. Source and Destination: Users can select a source and destination location on the grid.
2. Algorithm Selection: Users can choose between A*, BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
3. Visualization: The application visually demonstrates the pathfinding process on the grid.
4. Path Information: Once the shortest path is found, the application displays the path length and the order of nodes visited.
# Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. React
# Getting Started
To run the Shortest Path Finder locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/samridhi-sahu/shortest-path-finder.git
2. Open the project directory: cd shortest-path-finder
3. Install the dependencies: npm install
4. Start the development server: npm start

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Select a source and destination location on the grid.

Choose an algorithm from the options available (A*, BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra's algorithm).

Click the "Find Path" button to visualize the shortest path-finding process.

Once the path is found, the application will display the path length and the order of nodes visited.
