# Shortest Path Finder
Shortest Path Finder is a minor project that helps find the optimal path from a source location to a destination using various algorithms such as A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.

# Features
1. Source and Destination: Users can select a source and destination location on the grid.
2. Algorithm Selection: Users can choose between A*, BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
3. Visualization: The application visually demonstrates the pathfinding process on the grid.
4. Path Information: Once the shortest path is found, the application displays the path length and the order of nodes visited.
